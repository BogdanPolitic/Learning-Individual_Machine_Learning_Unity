# Learning-Individual

<h3> General description </h3>

This is a prototype, part of a huge Unity 3D project that I will be working on this year's span. It consists of a humanoid character which learns to do things being operated by Machine Learning techniques. I decided I would do the most aspects from scratch, and thus the character (+ animations) and apartment's structure are completely self-made (in Blender).

Actions the character is currently capable of:
- walking
- standing
- grabbing objects
- recognizing objects after a supervised training session

Short highlight of walking and dragging objects:
